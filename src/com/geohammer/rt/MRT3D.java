//3DMRT is a open-source tool for complicated 3D seismic ray tracing.
//a tool that can visualize the velocity models, traveltimes and ray trajectories in a 3D environment
//rapidly construct a 3D velocity model that can more accurately represent a realistic medium
//9 Eikonal solvers to utilize their advantages in different circumstances
//extracte ray trajectories from the traveltime domain
